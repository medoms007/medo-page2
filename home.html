                <p> officially the Syrian Arab Republic ( الجمهورية العربيةالسورية
                    ‎, Arabic:romanized: al-Jumhūrīyah al-ʻArabīyah as-Sūrīyah),</p>
                <p> is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon
                    to the southwest, the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan
                    to the
                    south, and Israel to the southwest. A country of fertile plains, high mountains, and deserts, Syria
                    is home
                    to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including Syrian Arabs, Kurds, Turkemens, Assyrians,
                    Armenians,
                    Circassians,[9] Mandeans[10] and Greeks. Religious groups include Sunnis, Christians, Alawites,
                    Druze,
                    Isma'ilis, Mandeans, Shiites, Salafis, Yazidis, and Jews. Arabs are the largest ethnic group, and
                    Sunnis the
                    largest religious group.

                <p> Syria is a unitary republic consisting of 14 governorates and is the only country that politically
                    espouses
                    Ba'athism. It is a member of one international organization other than the United Nations, the
                    Non-Aligned
                    Movement; it was suspended from the Arab League in November 2011[11] and the Organisation of Islamic
                    Cooperation, and self-suspended from the Union for the Mediterranean.
                </p>

                <p> The name "Syria" historically referred to a wider region, broadly synonymous with the Levant, and
                    known in
                    Arabic as al-Sham. The modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires,
                    including
                    the Eblan civilization of the 3rd millennium BC. Aleppo and the capital city Damascus are among the
                    oldest
                    continuously inhabited cities in the world.[14] In the Islamic era, Damascus was the seat of the
                    Umayyad
                    Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. The modern Syrian state was
                    established
                    in the mid-20th century after centuries of Ottoman and a brief period French mandate, and
                    represented the
                    largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Syrian provinces. It gained de jure
                    independence as a parliamentary republic on 24 October 1945, when the Republic of Syria became a
                    founding
                    member of the United Nations, an act which legally ended the former French Mandate, although French
                    troops
                    did not leave the country until April 1946. The post-independence period was tumultuous, with many
                    military
                    coups and coup attempts shaking the country from 1949 to 1971. In 1958, Syria entered a brief union
                    with
                    Egypt called the United Arab Republic, which was terminated by the 1961 Syrian coup d'état. The
                    republic was
                    renamed as the Arab Republic of Syria in late 1961 after the December 1 constitutional referendum of
                    that
                    year, and was increasingly unstable until the 1963 Ba'athist coup d'état, since which the Ba'ath
                    Party has
                    maintained its power. Syria was under Emergency Law from 1963 to 2011, effectively suspending most
                    constitutional protections for citizens.

                <p> Bashar al-Assad has been president since 2000 and was preceded by his father Hafez al-Assad, who was
                    in
                    office from 1971 to 2000. Throughout his rule, Syria and the ruling Ba'ath Party have been condemned
                    and
                    criticized for various human rights abuses, including frequent executions of citizens and political
                    prisoners, and massive censorship. Since March 2011, Syria has been embroiled in an armed conflict,
                    with
                    a number of countries in the region and beyond involved militarily or otherwise. As a result, a
                    number of
                    self-proclaimed political entities have emerged on Syrian territory, including the Syrian
                    opposition,
                    Rojava, Tahrir al-Sham and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Syria was ranked last on the Global
                    Peace
                    Index from 2016 to 2018, making it the most violent country in the world due to the war. The
                    conflict
                    has killed more than 570,000 people, caused 7.6 million internally displaced people (July 2015 UNHCR
                    estimate) and over 5 million refugees (July 2017 registered by UNHCR), making population assessment
                    difficult in recent years.
                </p>

                <p> As of June 2020, the national currency Syrian pound has plunged to new lows, and there are massive
                    protests
                    occurring due to the economic downturn; in addition, massive punitive sanctions about to be applied
                    by the
                    United States via the Caesar Act, are raising concerns about the possible collapse of the Syrian
                    government,
                    possibly resulting in massive instability and conflict throughout the region.
